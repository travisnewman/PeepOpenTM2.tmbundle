PeepOpen for TextMate 2
=======================

Since support for Textmate 2 seems [a long time coming](https://github.com/topfunky/PeepOpen-Issues/issues/272) I've figured out how to get it working in the meanwhile.  This should work with the latest PeepOpen binary without requiring any patches or recompiling.

Installing
----------

    cd ~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles/
    git clone https://github.com/yyyc514/PeepOpenTM2.tmbundle.git
