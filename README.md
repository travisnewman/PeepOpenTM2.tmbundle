PeepOpen for TextMate 2
=======================

Since support for Textmate 2 seems [a long time coming](https://github.com/topfunky/PeepOpen-Issues/issues/272) I've figured out how to get it working in the meanwhile.  This should work with the latest PeepOpen binary without requiring any patches or recompiling.

Just install this bundle like you would any other.
